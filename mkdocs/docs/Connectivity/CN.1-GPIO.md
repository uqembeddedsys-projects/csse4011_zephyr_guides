# CSSE4011: Connectivity - GPIO 

## **1.0 Motivation**

The following tutorial explores exposing the board GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) to userspace (an app) within Zephyr. Zephyr does things a little differently when it comes to interacting with hardware. In this tutorial, we will use the GPIO API to interact with GPIO pins. 

## **1.1 Test Hardware**

> Arduino Sense Board

> mUSB Cable

**This implementation is valid for Zephyr RTOS Version 2.7.XX**

## **1.2. Prerequisites**

Ensure that you have completed/understand the following tutorials. 
> OS.1, OS.2, OS.2.1 and BRD.1

## **1.3 Setup**

Connect the Arduino sense board to the host machine and ensure that the development environment has access to the device (USB passthrough to virtual machine).

## **2.0 Zephyr GPIO Implementation**
### **2.1 Boilerplate**

*The following commands assume that you have setup your files/directories following the respective tutorial(s).*

Create a new application directory for a sample gpio application. 

```shell
cd ~/csse4011/csse4011_repo/
mkdir -p apps/gpio_sample/
```
For setting up a basic boilerplate for our application, we will use the provided blinky sample in Zephyr. 

```shell
cd ~/csse4011/zephyrproject/zephyr/samples/basic/blinky
cp -R * ~/csse4011/csse4011_repo/apps/gpio_sample/
cd ~/csse4011/csse4011_repo/apps/gpio_sample/
```
**Alternatively, you may create your own application if desired.**

### **2.2 DeviceTree Summary**

```
"A devicetree is a hierarchical data structure that describes hardware...Zephyr uses devicetree to describe the hardware available on its Supported Boards, as well as that hardwareâ€™s initial configuration."
```

An extensive guide to DeviceTree Source (DTS) implementation can be found [here](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/2.7.0/guides/dts/intro.html) & [here](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/2.7.0/guides/dts/howtos.html#dt-howtos). Later in this course, you might need to describe hardware in a DTS overlay file and add it to the build system for Zephyr to access particular hardware that you may need to use. Adding DTS overlays has been covered in `OS.2.1-Building_Tips`. 

When an application is built for a particular board, Zephyr creates a final `zephyr.dts` file in the build directory. This file concatenates all selected hardware into this "final devicetree". Typically, it's a good idea to start here to see what the hardware description looks like for the current configuration of your build.

For instance, lets try building this boilerplate blinky app for the `Arduino_Nano_Sense`.
```shell
cd ~/csse4011/csse4011_repo/apps/gpio_sample/
west  build -p auto -b arduino_nano_33_ble
```
Once the build is complete, you can open up the "final DTS" at:
```shell
cd build/zephyr
vim zephyr.dts
```
Here we can see the **hardware description** for the `Arduino_Nano_Sense`. This information is exposed to userland/application in Zephyr, using a set of `macros` [see here](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/2.7.0/reference/devicetree/api.html#generic-apis).

In this tutorial, we are interested in GPIO, so we will look at how to toggle a particular GPIO pin from looking at the `zephyr.dts` file.

### **2.2 GPIO Interaction**

Typically, when you interact with new hardware, you must first enable the kernel driver for it, this is usually done using a kernel configuration file (KConfig). In our case for GPIO, it is enabled in the `prj.conf` file in the application directory with `CONFIG_GPIO=y`. Most boards will typically have basic hardware functionality like gpio, uart and i2c enabled by default in the board definitions (in the Zephyr source). You can refer to `OS.2.1-Building_Tips` for a guide on adding segmented KConf files to the build system. 

If you have already read through the blinky sample that we use as boilerplate, you may have already noticed that to toggle the led, it uses the `device-tree macros` from within the `main.c` file. 

For example,
```C
/* The devicetree node identifier for the "led0" alias. */
#define LED0_NODE DT_ALIAS(led0)

#if DT_NODE_HAS_STATUS(LED0_NODE, okay)
#define LED0    DT_GPIO_LABEL(LED0_NODE, gpios)
#define PIN     DT_GPIO_PIN(LED0_NODE, gpios)
#define FLAGS   DT_GPIO_FLAGS(LED0_NODE, gpios)
```
Here, `DT_ALIAS()` is used to find the reference `led0` within the DTS. This is a special case of using an alias. If we look in the `zephyr.dts` file, you will notice that `led0` is specified as `aliases{}`. So this macro "returns a node identifier for the node which is aliased".

When you follow the `led0` alias in `zephyr.dts`, you will notice that it simply maps to a GPIO pin. Aliases can help abstract the hardware within the devicetree and make them easy to access. 

### **2.4 DeviceTree GPIO Access**
Lets investigate toggling a particular GPIO that is not aliased. We will use the `Arduino_Nano_Sense` for this tute. You can find the board pinout [here](https://content.arduino.cc/assets/Pinout-NANOsense_latest.pdf). We will use the GPIO pin `P0.13` (internally connected to the top left led) for this. This pin maps on `P0`, in the `zephyr.dts` this is `gpio0`. For instance, pin `D6`, will be in `gpio1`. 


Start by editing the source file and append the following
```shell
vim src/main.c
```
Use `DT_NODELABEL` to get the respective node_id for for `gpio0` from DTS.
```C
/* DeviceTree get node ID from label */
#define GPIO0 DT_NODELABEL(gpio0)
#define GPIO_A0 0x0D                //PIN PO.13
```
In our main function, let's init the GPIO PIN.
```C
const struct device *dev_gpio0;
dev_gpio0 = device_get_binding(DT_LABEL(GPIO0));

/* Configure PIN_A0 as an Output with that is Active Low */
ret = gpio_pin_configure(dev_gpio0, GPIO0_13, GPIO_OUTPUT_ACTIVE | GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW);
```
Notice here, that `device_get_binding()` will not except a `NODE_ID`, but it does accept a `NODE_LABEL`, hence why `DT_LABEL` is used. `DT_LABEL` is a helper macro that does the same as `DT_PROP(GPIO0, label)`. The `struct device` [see here](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/2.7.0/reference/drivers/index.html#c.device) returned by this function call describes the particular hardware and is used by the API to interface to that particular device/hardware. 

and finally in our while loop, we can toggle this pin.

```C
while (1) {
    gpio_pin_set(dev, PIN, (int)led_is_on);
    /* Toggle the PIN */
    gpio_pin_set(dev_gpio0, GPIO0_13, (int)led_is_on);
    led_is_on = !led_is_on;
    k_msleep(SLEEP_TIME_MS);
}   
```

## **4.0 Testing**

This application can now be built and flashed using:
```shell
west  build -p auto -b arduino_nano_33_ble
west flash --bossac=$HOME/csse4011/BOSSA/BOSSA/bin/bossac   #Check the Path is correct
```

You should see that the **top-led led is now flashing orange** alongside the red led (led0) from the boilerplate code. 

## **4.1 Sample Application**

A sample application has been provided, this application includes all the steps mentioned above.
